# Strata on two or three GPUs (layer split)

One model can run across several NVIDIA cards in one PC. The layers are split into contiguous ranges, one per GPU:
the first card runs layers 0 to K-1, the next card runs K onward, and so on; the last card also runs the output head
and the draft (MTP) layer. Each card keeps an expert cache for **its own layers only**, so two cards hold about twice
the experts one card holds - for the Coder model on a 16 GB + 24 GB pair, nearly all of them, which is where the
speed comes from (decode then barely touches the CPU pool).

This is pipeline (layer) parallelism, not tensor parallelism: a token crosses from one card to the next once per
verify window (a few hundred KB through pinned RAM), not twice per layer. No NVLink or peer-to-peer access is
needed; cards on x4 or x1 slots work, and the PCIe share of each card is probed on its own link. A `--pcie-frac` you give
is every card's share and skips those probes; there is no per-card setting yet.

## Using it

**Nothing to type.** `START-HERE.bat` (Linux: `./setup.sh`) lists your NVIDIA cards and says for each one whether
Strata can use it:

```
  Your NVIDIA GPUs:
    GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080, 16 GB VRAM - can be used
    GPU 1: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, 11 GB VRAM - not supported - older than the RTX 20 series (compute capability 6.1; Strata needs 7.5 or newer)
    GPU 2: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, 24 GB VRAM - can be used
  ...
  1) GPU 0 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080, 16 GB) + GPU 2 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, 24 GB) together   (recommended)
  2) GPU 2 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, 24 GB) only
  3) GPU 0 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080, 16 GB) only
Which GPUs? [1]:
```

When two or more cards can share the model, the two best together are recommended (the newest generation first:
it becomes the main card). A model installed on one card asks once, at its next start, whether to use both from
now on; the answer is kept.

**Choosing yourself** (at setup or at any start):

```
--gpus 0,2                 these cards together, as nvidia-smi numbers them; the first is the main one. Remembered.
--gpus all                 every card that can share the model
--gpu 0                    one card (at a start: for that start only)
--layer-split auto         (default) or the first layer of each later card, e.g. 18 or 16,32
```

**Not supported** (setup says so and names the cards that can be used instead):
- a card older than the RTX 20 series (compute capability below 7.5: GTX 10 and older);
- a card with less than 8 GB of VRAM, together with others (each card needs shared weights, its layer weights and
  its own prompt buffers) - unless you name it with `--gpus`: then setup says the risk and asks (`--yes` with the named
  cards goes ahead);
- Intel GPUs, and a mix of NVIDIA and AMD cards. (AMD cards share a model among themselves: `./setup.sh --backend
  hip --gpus 1,0`, see [AMD_HIP.md](AMD_HIP.md).)

Or edit an existing config (`strata-*.json`), then restart:

```json
"gpu": [0, 2],
"layer_split": "auto"
```

**Skip the split when the first card holds everything** (opt-in, 0.1.31): `"split_skip_if_fits": true` in the config
(engine flag `--split-skip-if-fits`, with `--layer-split auto`) runs on the first card alone when it holds every
profiled expert plus the context's KV, the draft layer and the reserve, and says so in the log; otherwise the split
stays. On an R9700 32 GB + RX 9070 XT the R9700 holds all of the Coder's experts: with the flag 4K prompts read at
1,776 tok/s instead of 1,244 (split) and decode runs at ~60 tok/s instead of ~51 (16K prompts ~5% slower than split).

**Short prompts on a split (0.1.32, #340).** 0.1.30 gave each card's prompt path a loan from its own expert cache,
refilled after every request; on cards that hold nearly all their experts that cost short prompts up to a third of
their speed. 0.1.32 refills all cards at once, uses a smaller streaming ring on a split, and lets a card with free
VRAM keep its own prompt buffers - the same output as 0.1.31, measured on an R9700 + RX 9070 XT: 2K prompts 993 ->
1,265 tok/s, 16K 1,852 -> 1,950, decode unchanged. `STRATA_SPLIT_OWN=1` (opt-in) gives every card its own buffers:
2K 1,450 and 16K 2,227 tok/s there, but a full card then keeps a different set of experts resident, so the output
differs from the default's (stable and coherent); `STRATA_SPLIT_OWN=auto` does that only where the buffers are at
most 12% of each card's VRAM.

The engine flags behind it: `--layer-split K1[,K2..]|auto` and `--split-device D1[,D2..]` (the later stages'
devices; default the next visible ones). `--layer-split K --split-device 0` runs both stages on one card sharing
everything - the bit-exact check of the hand-off, not a speed mode.

`--vram-reserve-mib` takes a comma list per card: `1024,384` keeps 1024 MiB free on CUDA0 and 384 MiB on CUDA1 (a
single value is every card's, the last value repeats for further cards). One reserve for both cards over-holds the
card that only carries layers: the last card also runs the output head and the draft layer, and its reserve is where
those come from, so it wants the bigger number and the plain layer card the smaller one. The split's boundary search
and each card's expert cache then size themselves from their own card's reserve.

**auto** tries every placement for two or three cards; beyond that it shares layers in proportion to estimated GPU
speed. It estimates layer compute time and the cost of experts missing from the caches, with hotter pairs weighted
more. Each candidate accounts for its own layer weights, shared weights and session state before pricing the cache.
The choice is made from file headers before any dense weights are uploaded. The startup log prints the choice:

```
strata generate: layer split auto: K=19 - the caches hold 11767 of 12288 profiled pairs (fullest device 100%)
strata serve: layer split: layers 0-18 (CUDA0), 19-47 (CUDA1), one hand-off per window
```

## What each card holds

- **every card**: dense weights for its own layers, retained shared/global weights, its own session state (its layers'
  KV cache at the configured context capacity), its verify window and its prompt-path buffers, and an expert cache
  for its layers filled from the profile. Per-layer canonical and native weights outside its range are not uploaded.
  The PLE input module's weights are retained even though their names start with `blk.1.ple_`;
- **the last card**: also runs the output head and the draft layer (MTP); the full-vocabulary draft head also uses VRAM;
- **host RAM**: the expert arena once, shared by all cards (the CPU pool computes whatever no card holds).

Measured 2026-10-03 on an i5-13500, RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB + RTX 4060 8 GB, 64 GB RAM, IQ4_XS with Q2 MTP and
all 248,320 draft tokens: with layers 0–1 on the 4060 and layers 2–47 plus output head/MTP on the 5070 Ti,
limiting dense weights to each card's layers reduced the 4060's dense allocation from about 4.29 GiB to
0.23 GiB. Its cache grew from 718 to all 1,024 experts; the 5070 Ti's grew from 2,690 to 2,771.
A fresh six-request comparison generated 43.41 tok/s before and 42.60 tok/s after: the memory saving did
not establish a speed gain. Identical-residency checks produced the same three greedy responses.
[Settings and raw results](../bench/results/2026-10-03-dense-layer-placement/report.md).

Prompts are read in chunks that flow through the cards in turn; while a later card reads chunk c, the first card
already reads chunk c+1. Conversation checkpoints save and restore every card's state; the adaptive expert swaps copy
into the card that owns the layer.

## Limits (for now)

- **Works across cards** (bench/results/2026-09-29-layer-split-limits):
  - images (`--vision`): each card keeps its own image-position table;
  - control vectors and the experimental speed projection: each card holds the vector's tables, switched on and
    off per request on all of them;
  - KV streaming (`--kv-resident`): each card streams the KV of its own session;
  - mid-prompt checkpoints (`--prompt-cache-every`): each card saves its part of a checkpoint when it has read that
    chunk;
  - the older helper-GPU caches (`--expert-cache-remote`, docs/SECOND_GPU.md): they take the visible GPUs no stage
    runs on, and hold only experts no stage's cache holds. On the test rig, a 2080 Ti helper made decoding slower,
    as it did without a split: its per-layer round trip costs more than the CPU pool needs for those experts.
- `--mmap-experts` needs a canonical pack (`experts.bin`), with or without a split; a native (IQ) pack says so at
  start.
- The prompt path has its own buffers on every card (1.5 GB each at the default 2048-token chunk; `--prefill 1024`
  halves that) instead of borrowing cache slots as one card does. An explicit `--expert-cache` on the first card is
  capped to leave room for them.
- Under WDDM (Windows, and WSL2) only 8 GiB of the expert arena is pinned (more, mapped into two GPU contexts,
  leaves WDDM refusing allocations); the rest streams through the pinned staging ring. A Linux driver has no such
  limit, so there the whole arena is pinned (since 0.1.31; the cap cost a 4090 + 3060 split two thirds of its
  prompt speed, #253). `STRATA_ARENA_PIN_GIB=N` pins at most N GiB, `0` the whole arena, on any OS.
- Every card needs compute capability 7.5 (RTX 20 or newer). The pre-sm_80 QSA scorer path is fp32 FMAs, so a
  Turing card runs the same kernels instead of the tensor-core prompt attention.

## Measured

The Coder on an RTX 5080 + RTX 3090 (Ryzen 9 9950X3D), 32K context; details in
`bench/results/2026-09-29-layer-split/`:

| | Prompt 16K / 28K tok/s | Decode story / code tok/s |
|---|---|---|
| 5080 alone | 1,726-2,017 / 1,970 | 83-87 / 88-105 |
| 5080 + 3090, best split (K=26) | 2,039 / 2,357 | 84 / 110 |
| 5080 + 3090, auto (K=22) | 2,037 / 2,073 | 80 / 109 |

- **Prompts gain the most** (+18-20%): each card reads its own layers of the chunk while the other reads the next.
- **Decode is on par with the faster card alone**, and ahead on code. Once both caches hold nearly every routed
  expert, the per-layer GPU time decides.
- **Correctness:** one GPU is byte-identical to 0.1.20, and the hand-off itself is bit-exact.

**Which cards and in what order:**
- Put the fastest card first; auto gives it as many layers as its cache allows.
- Leave out a much slower card when two already hold the model. An RTX 2080 Ti as a third card made the 5080 +
  3090 pair slower (68 / 90 tok/s decode): every extra card costs its own round per window.
- More cards pay off when the model's routed experts do not fit the faster ones.
